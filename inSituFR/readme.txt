1) Slides showing cheating closure in backup
2) Denominator selections in slide
3) Regular HH closure
4) Now change denominator isolation part to only miniIso < 0.4 and show HH closure
5) Now change iso part back and relax MVA as below and show HH closure

       - Isolated trigger denominator: (0.05, -0.26, -0.40)
       - Non-isolated trigger denominator: (-0.36,-0.58,-0.62)
          - will need to bypass the passIsolatedFO stuff in order to use this since this is looser than that
